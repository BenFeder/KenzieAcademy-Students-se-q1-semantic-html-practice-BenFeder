# Semantic HTML Practice

Update the markup as follows:

1. Wrap the main body of the page in a `<main>` tag
2. There are a number of `<div>`'s with class names that have an HTML5 equivalent that should be replaced

Please note that there is no need to change any of the CSS inside the `<style>` tags. You will only be modifying the HTML within the `<body>`.
